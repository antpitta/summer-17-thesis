\textsc{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Background
  \bigskip
  
	  \begin{enumerate}
	  \item Starting from scratch: it was easy and clearly documented how to logon to the Comet site.
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item Also clear to NOT run simulations in the home directoty
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item {\color{red}UNCLEAR} How to get ChaNGa and charmrun on to Comet.
	  
	  a) Getting those programs on the laptop was achieved without using Git.
	  
	  b) After the first 20-minute session with Tom that got ChaNGa finally running on EBTH it was clear the Git needed to be understood.
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item Umali's book on Git was a great help.
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item Mahidhar indicate that Git was on Comet, but I could not easily figure out how to find it.  Should more precisely document that answer.  Basically, it took some poking around on Comet to find ``bin.''  A good HW assignment.
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item {\color{blue}Git clone}.  Umali's book helped to figure out the vagaries of Git jargon that confuse the process in many other sources. Examples are the word ``repository,'' ``cloning,'' etc.
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item After practicing with Umali's stuff -- just a little, then at the command line it was possible to try some Git clones in Comet.
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item Some recommended command line stuff was slightly wrong.  Cannot remember, how I figured out how to enter the correct 
	  
	  git clone \_\_
	  
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item Somehow the git clone commands worked and changa and charm ``repositories'' -- really just directories.
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item After that success, Comet languished for awhile because I was trying to make some progress on ICIng which involved finding a good way to learn Python.
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item No Starch Press, Crash Python Course has some problems, but did the job and I wrote a couple of Python programs
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item I tried to build ChaNGa and charmrun about the last week of Feb. 2016 and got a make error.
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item I sent the ``make'' error to Mahidhar and got a great response. 
	  
	  a. He started working on the problem in earnest, and I seemed to be able to help a bit.  The details about this interaction would be great.
	  
	  b. He got ChaNGa ... so that was great then he wanted to try to run the simulation.
	  
	  c. I copied testcosmo and it's relevant parts to Comet.
	  
	  d. I also copied ChaNGa and charmrun to that folder.
	  

	  e. I ran into Tom and indicated that I was making great progress on Comet.
	  
	  f. The next day, Friday 2016-02-03  I saw Tom and he mentioned {\color{red}verbs} but I was pretty confused, so he invited me to his office.  Just before going to Tom's office I looked for the testcosmo-comet folder, and it was gone.

	  g.  Mahidhar transferred that folder to ``Oasis'' for running, but I didn't know that.
	  
	  h. When I looked at Mahidhar's code it was clear that he was trying to use the {\color{red}verb} implementation.   I spent some time reading about InfiniBand -- cool system for allowing applications to talk to each toher without having to go through the OS.  I suggested to Mahidhar, that he try the straight MPI implementation -- which kind of ruins the point of  charm, but should be a great first steap.
	  \bigskip	
	 
	  \item Tom almost got ChaNGa running on Comet, and then the next day Mahidhar got it running.

\textsc{Put together a plan for what needs documentation}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
  \bigskip
  
In Tom's office he did the following which I need to review and document from the history command.
  \bigskip

  \item 
  \bigskip

  He copied a qsub - sbatch file from {\color{red}his} Comet folders!
  \bigskip
  \item
  \bigskip

{\color{blue} Assignment: figure out the difference between qsub and sbatch}
Thought that they were synonyms, but seems not.  First stab, maybe qsub is the command line statement and sbatch is part of the script?  
  \bigskip
  \item
  \bigskip
  
Tom mentioned the ``option'' of the command for running a build that uses the
{\color{red}j} -- It was clear that this option of the build command employed more {\color{blue}either cores or processors -- another potential assignment} because I could see it running faster compared to what I had just done on my own.
  \bigskip
  \item
  \bigskip

So the ``j'' option is clear on the {\color{red}operational} level.  
  \bigskip
  \item
  \bigskip
  
  There are many command line statements that both Tom and Mahidhar were using that will need lots of study.
  \bigskip
  \item
  \bigskip
  
  The Conclusion in Tom's office was that my version of ChaNGa was way too old.
  \bigskip
  \item
  \bigskip
  
  Tom was able to see that Mahidhar had tried to implement the ibverbs version from the history of commands.
  \bigskip
  \item
  \bigskip
  
 Tom tried to set up the MPI-only version also.  So that conclusion on my own was correct.
  \bigskip
  \item
  \bigskip
  
  In attempting that implementation he copied over the qsub file -- so that file should be somewhere on Comet.
  \bigskip
  \item
  \bigskip
  
  Tom was in oasis {\color{red}(need to figure out exactly what oasis is)}
  
  a. Oasis is some portion of the processors on Comet that allow for submission of computations.  I imagine that Oasis is not the full ``portion'' of Comet that allows for huge computations.
  \bigskip

\textsc{In Comet -- trying to figure out what made the simulation work}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  \bigskip

{\color{red}REALLY GOOD FIND} In the changa Makefile I found the following unexpected -- funny -- line:

CHARM\_PATH = /home/antpitta/Build2/charm-6.7.2/mpi-linux-x86\_64-ifort-smp-mpicxx

In this part of the Makefile there are a whole slew of \_PATH statements
  
  \bigskip

  \item
  \bigskip
  
  There is an entire \emph{world} of computer science-like stuff in that Makefile.  Such as lots of references to CUDA -- which is for graphical processor implementation.  Lots of references to Tipsy.
  
  
  \bigskip
  \item {\color{red}ANOTHER REALLY GOOD FIND} Poking around the Build2 directory, I cd'd into the utilities sub-directory then vim'd into the ``SimulationHandler.'' The same /home/antpitta/Build2 stuff appeared.
  
  a.  It's starting to seem that Mahidhar had to create a build folder from scratch to get the simulation working.  It seems that folder is the folder for the mpi--straight implementation.

  {\color{red}what's going on here?}
  \bigskip
  
  Using the vi editor to look at a dot qsub file.  This command
  helps me to understand submission of jobs using SLURM.
  
  This confirms the fact that Tom made a file called cube300.qsub.  This kind of information must be on the XSEDE site.
  
  
  \begin
 {verbatim}  
  730  sbatch *.qsub

  \end{verbatim}
  {\color{red}what's going on here?}
  \bigskip
  
  sbatch set of letters that appears in a script, cf. pg. 17 this doc.
  
  \begin{verbatim}  


  731  squeue | grep antpitt
  732  ls -lrt
  733  more DIAG
\end{verbatim}

  {\color{red}what's DIAG -- 2016-03-16: saw a diag somewhere yesterday.}
  \bigskip
  
DIAG is short for diagnostic\begin{verbatim} http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net/.  \end{verbatim}
  
  \begin{verbatim}  
  734  vi *.qsub
  735  more DIAG
  736  vi *.qsub
  737  sbatch *.qsub
  
  \end{verbatim}



  {\color{red}Real confusing for me.  sbatch is already in *.qsub}
  
  Is qsub (queue submission -- maybe) a file type or a command? Or is the question silly?
  
  The man page for qsub --- has the word POSIX at the top?
  
from stackexchange:

  ``POSIX first was a standard in 1988 long before the Single UNIX Specification. It was one of the attempts at unifying all the various UNIX forks and UNIX-like systems. POSIX is an IEEE Standard, but as the IEEE does not own the UNIX¨ trademark, the standard is not UNIX¨ though it is based on the existing UNIX API at that time. The first standard POSIX.1 is formally known as IEEE std 1003.1-1988.[1] IEEE charged a substantial fee to obtain a copy of the standard.''
  
  doesn't help too much ... a little.
  
  I was hoping that somehow POSIX allows \# signs in the script.
  
  Rahul said {\color{red}preprocesors were OK with those pound signs}
  
  \bigskip
  
\begin{verbatim}
  
  738  ls -lrt

The file below is the file cube300.qsub -- I believe that Tom wrote this while I was in his office.  Gotta be true because his address is in here.

  \end{verbatim}

\item Here are my comments on this cube300.qsub script.

  \begin{verbatim}
  
  #!/bin/bash               
  
a.  What does the pound sign mean?  In some contexts the pound sign is a comment, but NOT here.
  
b. /bin is understandable as a directory where applications live, and maybe /bash  as bourne again shell
  
#SBATCH --partition=compute

What code is this written in?  It doesn't look like a normal script.  The  ``--partition'' looks like a long option.  No idea about the equals sign and compute.

Where do I find out about these questions? The Comet user manual might give a hint but not very explicitly.

#SBATCH --nodes=1

The function of this line is clear, i.e. specifies the number of nodes.  Wait, I am confusing processors and nodes. Probably mentioned in astro 598

#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1

It would be nice to know the meaning of number of tasks per node.

The definition of node is on the XSEDE Oakridge site.  How many processors per node?

#SBATCH -t 00:10:00

a single dash in front of the ``t'' means the short form of the option.

#SBATCH --export=ALL

Q: Uppercase matters?  Looks like it from the man page below -- cannot put it in verbatim mode  because we are already in verbatim mode.

from the {\color{red}man page}


``       --export=<environment variables | ALL | NONE>
              Identify which environment variables are propagated to the
              batch job.  Multiple environment variable names should  be
              comma separated.  Environment variable names may be speci-
              fied to propagate the current  value  of  those  variables
              (e.g.  "--export=EDITOR") or specific values for the vari-
              ables may be exported (e.g.. "--export=EDITOR=/bin/vi") in
              addition to the environment variables that would otherwise
              be set.  This option particularly important for jobs  that
              are  submitted  on  one cluster and execute on a different
              cluster (e.g. with different paths). By default all  envi-
              ronment  variables are propagated. If the argument is NONE
              or  specific  environment   variable   names,   then   the
              --get-user-env option will implicitly be set to load other
              environment variables based upon the userÕs  configuration
              on the cluster which executes the job.''


# #SBATCH --mail-user=trq@astro.washington.edu

Are the double pound signs my mistake?

from the man page for SBATCH

``       --mail-user=<user>
              User  to  receive  email  notification of state changes as
              defined by --mail-type.  The default value is the  submit-
              ting user.''
              
A bit tricky ... {\color{red}user} could have just been the user 
name as opposed to the user's e-mail address. 
              


# #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#  ONLY FOR VERBS ./charmrun +p 24 ++mpiexec 
++remote-shell $HOME/bin/mympiexec $
PWD/ChaNGa -v 1 -p 4096 +balancer MultistepLB_notopo dwf1.2048.param

ibrun -v ./ChaNGa +p 23 ++ppn 23 -v 1 
+balancer MultistepLB_notopo 
cube300.param >& DIAG
~           

The following quote is from the new uw astro wiki:

http://depts.washington.edu/astron/w/index.php?title=Research:ChaNGa_Issues

``#!/bin/csh
shift; shift; exec ibrun $*
and you would call it with:

charmrun +p<procs> ++mpiexec ++remote-shell mympiexec ChaNGa cosmo.param''

{\color{red}procs} means number of processors.  
processor is synonymous with core.  For example, ``+p<procs>'' means +p 23

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  \bigskip

\textsc{Core}

A core is an individual processor: the part of a computer which actually executes programs. CPUs used to have a single core, and the terms were interchangeable. In recent years, several cores, or processors, have been manufactured on a single CPU chip, which may be referred to as a multiprocessor. It is important to note, however, that the relationship between the cores may vary radically: AMD's Opteron, Intel's Itanium, and IBM's Cell have very distinct setups.

  
  \bigskip

  \item
  \bigskip

\textsc{CPU}

CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, and is the part of a computer which executes software programs. The term is not specific to a particular method of execution: units based on transistors, relays, or vacuum tubes might be considered CPU's. However, for clarity, we will use the term to refer to individual silicon chips, such as Intel's Pentium or AMD's Athlon. Thus, a CPU contains one or more cores, however, an HPC system may contain many CPU's. For example, Kraken contains several thousand AMD Opteron CPU's.  
  \bigskip
  
  \item
\textsc{  Node}

In traditional computing, a node is an object on a network. 

$\rightarrow$ so abstract.

For example, on a home network, your computer, router, and printer might all be nodes. 

$\rightarrow$ hmm

Supercomputers like Kraken are essentially networks, with nodes that communicate with each other to solve a larger problem than any singular computer could in a reasonable amount of time. 

$\rightarrow$ essentially networks!

Kraken contains {\color{red}several types of nodes}; {\color{blue}compute nodes} are the work-horses of the system, and are much like a stripped-down computer. An {\color{blue} I/O node} is the interface between the compute nodes and other computers, that is, it deals with input and output for the system.
  
  \bigskip

  \item
\textsc{Scratch Space}

Supercomputers generally have what is called scratch space: disk space available for temporary use. It is analogous to scratch paper. This may be thought of as a desk: it is where papers are stored while they are waiting to be worked on or filed away.

$\rightarrow$ OK. Oasis is scratch space.  One way to tell is that the letters ``temp'' are in part of Mahidhar's implementation.

\textsc{   sbatch }- 
   
   Submit a batch script to Slurm.  Slurm = Simple Linux utility resource management.
   
   How are batch scripts different that normal, i.e. non-batch scripts?
   
   The pound sign seems to be different that a normal script, no?
  
  \bigskip

  \item
  \textsc{Slurm}
  
  Simple Linux user resource management.
  
  a man page exists on Comet
  
  http://slurm.schedmd.com/
  
  A new method of processing requests to run a program.

  \item
 \textsc{daemon}
  
  In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon (/?di?m?n/ or /?de?m?n/) is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

  \textsc{failover}
  
``If one of the servers, or nodes, fails, another node in the cluster can take over its workload without any downtime (this process is known as failover).
